Description: CLI tool to verify file integrity using hash algorithms
 TruthByte verifies file integrity by comparing computed hashes against
 expected values. It supports multiple hash algorithms (SHA256, SHA512, 
 SHA1, MD5) and can process both individual files and entire directories.
 .
 Features:
  * Single file verification against provided hash values
  * Directory-based verification using hash files
  * Recursive mode for checking subdirectories
  * Flexible hash file format compatibility
  * Output logging to text files
  * Color-coded console output
 .
 TruthByte is ideal for verifying downloads, backups, or any scenario
 requiring file integrity validation. The tool is accessible via both
 'truthbyte' and 'tb' commands.
